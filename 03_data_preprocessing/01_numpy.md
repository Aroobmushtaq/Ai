# Introduction to NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library for numerical computing. It provides a powerful N-dimensional array object, mathematical functions, random number capabilities, and tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.

# Why Use NumPy?
- Faster than Python lists due to optimized C backend.
- Uses less memory and provides built-in mathematical functions.
- Supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Enables vectorized operations for efficiency.
